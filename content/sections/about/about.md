My name is **Shinyoung You**, and I'm currently a Term 2 student at BCIT majoring in Computer Systems Technology (CST) in Vancouver, BC.

After finishing 6 months of coding bootcamp, I have 5 months of related internship experience at Cube Design and Communication and Vancouver Fashion Week.

At Vancouver Fashion Week, I learned how to effectively **communicate** and quickly **adapt** by collaborating with the team to troubleshoot technical issues for a seamless user experience.

At Cube Design and Communication, I redesigned a website using Vue.js, Firebase, and Google Domains. I built a multilingual support with an internationalization plugin, Vue I18n to the redesigned website.

In addition to my work experience, working on school team projects a couple of times helped me improve my **leadership** skills as a project manager or frontend lead within the team.

To become a developer specialized in **Backend**, I have created several web-based apps as part of my personal projects.
