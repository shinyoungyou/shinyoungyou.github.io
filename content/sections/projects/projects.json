That's when I thought of creating an app that would help students connect with native speakers of the language they want to learn. \n After I finished a coding bootcamp, I felt like I didn't have enough skill in backend development. To fix this, I spent time learning ASP.NET. While doing so, I learned many things, like how to use the CQRS pattern and how to add real-time chatting with SignalR. \n Since I had just picked up new backend skills, I decided to combine my idea with what I had learned. That's how I ended up building my language exchange app.",
